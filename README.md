### Task 1: Finding the Minimum Element

**Description**  
Write the function that returns the minimum element in an array.

**Solution Overview**  
The solution involves an iterative approach. We initialize the minimum value as the first element of the array and compare it with each element of the array, updating the minimum value as necessary.

### Task 2: Average of Elements in Array

**Description**  
Write a function that returns the average of elements in an array.

**Solution Overview**
This method computes the average of elements in an array using a simple iterative approach. It iterates through the array, summing up all the elements, and then divides the total sum by the number of elements to obtain the average.

### Task 3: Prime Number Check Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a recursive function to check whether a given number is prime.

**Solution Overview**  
The solution implements a recursive function to check whether a given number is prime.

### Task 4: Factorial Calculation Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a recursive program to find the factorial of a given number.

**Solution Overview**  
The solution recursively calculates the factorial of a given number by multiplying the number with the factorial of its preceding number until it reaches the base case, that is, 1.

### Task 5: Fibonacci Sequence Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a recursive function to find the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence.

**Solution Overview**  
The solution recursively calculates the nth element in the Fibonacci sequence by summing the (n-1)th and (n-2)th elements until reaching the base cases.

### Task 6: Exponentiation Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a function to calculate the power of a number using recursion.

**Solution Overview**  
This solution recursively calculates the power of a number by multiplying the base number with itself (n-1) times.

### Task 7: Reverse Array Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a program to reverse an array without using an array data structure.

**Solution Overview**  
The solution reverses an array recursively by swapping the first and last elements.

### Task 8: Check if String Contains Only Digits

**Description**  
Write a function to check if a string consists only of digits.

**Solution Overview**  
This solution recursively checks whether a given string consists only of digits.

### Task 9: Binomial Coefficient Calculation Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a program to calculate the binomial coefficient using recursion.

**Solution Overview**  
This solution recursively calculates the binomial coefficient using the formula C(n, k) = C(n-1, k-1) + C(n-1, k) until reaching the base cases of k = 0 or k = n.

### Task 10: GCD Calculation Using Recursion

**Description**  
Write a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using recursion.

**Solution Overview**  
This solution recursively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean Algorithm.
